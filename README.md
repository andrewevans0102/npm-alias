# NPM Aliases

This is a very small project that showcases an npm alias. It shows how you can install different npm packages under different names if you need to refer to them in your project or want to try out a new version.

This project is a companion to my post [creating aliases with npm](https://rhythmandbinary.com/post/2021-12-06-creating-aliases-with-npm).
